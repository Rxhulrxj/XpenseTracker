## Tech Stack

- [React](https://reactjs.org) 
  - Create-react-app with highly complex frontend structure
- [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) 
  - State management and redux thunk for asynchronous api calls
- [React Router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/guides/quick-start) 
  - Complex and dynamic route generation.



## Implementation Highlights

Xpense Tracker made with advanced react, redux & reacter-dom . Features include a  user can add and analyze their expenditure and after their use they can remove it.And the data is stored in this project using an 
efficienct way using localstorage.

### User Stories

- Users can Add and Analyze their Expenditure.
- Users can Delete their Expenditure after their use.

### Current Plans for Expansion

- Implement more features as a personal practice project
- Adding Monthly Expenditure Calculation to the website
- Adding more fun and cool things to have more interaction with the site to the user.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
